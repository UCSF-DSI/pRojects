## RStudio Projects

Now that we'll start working with data files, it's a good idea to get into the habit of using RStudio Projects to organize your work..

By using **RStudio Projects**, you can ensure all the data, code, and documentation for your projects are accessible in a single place.

To create a new project, go to *File -\> New Project...\** from the top menu. In the window the appears, select *New Directory -\> New Project*. Then give your project a name and choose where to save your project.

This will create a new folder in the location where you chose to save your new project. In this folder, you should now see a *.Rproj* file. You can use this *.Rproj* file as a shortcut to open your project in RStudio.
